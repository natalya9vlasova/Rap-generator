# Task-2.-Rap-generator
Dear Eugeny, I ask You to check the latest file (Task 2_Rap generator with sane perplexity), which shows better results than the other one.
The second file contains worse results with equal perplexity for all ngrams, but I still could not find the mistake, therefore, I would like the file to remain here.
